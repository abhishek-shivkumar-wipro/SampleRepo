Future Scope:
    The Graph API presents a simple, consistent view of the Facebook social graph, uniformly representing objects in the graph (e.g., people, photos, events, and pages) and the connections between them. Using the Facebook Graph API, we can get more metadata from Facebook about the users including:

    * Friends: 
    * News feed: 
    * Profile feed (Wall): 
    * Likes: 
    * Movies: 
    * Music: 
    * Books: 
    * Notes: 
    * Permissions: 
    * Photo Tags: 
    * Photo Albums: 
    * Video Tags: 
    * Video Uploads: 
    * Events: 
    * Groups: 
    * Checkins:
